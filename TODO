- Add sanity check for space remaining on disc.
    - Use flat % to determine when not to backup?
    - Only check space when resquashing?

- Implement options
    -c <config file>    specify path to different config

- Add logging -- need to figure out how to handle color output

- Filter output from commands
    -mostly done, mksquashfs is still noisy

- Reorganize resquash code. Reused bits need to all end up out of the backup func so
  that its possible in the future for a user to resquash without having to do a backup
  first.

- Figure out a better way to detect mounts with mountpoint. Using grep is not acceptable
